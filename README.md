Project Documentation: *Basketball Dribble Analysis with Computer Vision*

Overview:
This project aims to analyze a basketball dribble video using computer vision techniques. The main tasks include detecting humans and basketballs in the video and counting dribbles.

Note:
I have developed custom cascades using basketball images as there are no pre-trained cascades available online specifically for basketball detection. 
Consequently, the model's accuracy is lower compared to models trained on more diverse datasets.

Analysis Methods:

Human Detection:
Utilized the Haar Cascade Classifier for detecting humans in the video frames.
Implemented the detectMultiScale function to detect multiple instances of humans at different scales.
Drawn bounding boxes around detected humans using OpenCV.

Basketball Detection:
Employed a custom created cascade classifier to detect basketballs in the video frames.
Utilized the detectMultiScale function with suitable parameters for robust basketball detection.
Implemented bounding box drawing similar to human detection.

Dribble Counting:
Analyzed the motion of the basketball to count dribbles.
Calculated the vertical motion of the basketball between frames.
If the vertical motion exceeded a threshold, incremented the dribble count.

Haar Cascade Classifier:
Used for object detection in images and videos.
Employs a custom cascade of classifiers based on Haar-like features.
Trained using positive and negative images to detect specific objects.

Motion Analysis:
Calculated the motion of the basketball by comparing its positions between frames.
Detected upward motion to count dribbles.

Color Detection:
Converted images to the HSV color space for better color analysis.
Applied thresholding to segment specific colors.

Challenges Faced:

Training the cascades:
While training the cascade, it required a substantial amount of time to create the final output, 
demanding extensive computational resources and patience throughout the iterative optimization process.


Accuracy of Detection:
Ensuring accurate detection of humans and basketballs amidst varying lighting conditions and backgrounds.
Required parameter tuning and testing on diverse video datasets.

Dribble Counting:
Determining an appropriate threshold for detecting dribbles based on basketball motion.
Required experimentation to balance sensitivity and specificity.

Code Documentation:
Each section of the code is properly commented to explain its purpose and functionality.
Descriptive variable names are used to enhance code readability.
Usage of OpenCV functions and parameters is documented to aid understanding.

Conclusion:
In summary, this project demonstrates the power of computer vision in basketball analysis. 
By detecting humans and basketballs in video footage, it sets the stage for more insightful analytics. 
With further development, such technology holds the promise of revolutionizing how we understand and enhance the model performance.
